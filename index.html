                    <div class="main-text">In the digital world, advertising creative is pushed to the audience through Content Delivery Networks. The impressions occur on desktop browsers, online video players, and mobile apps whose IP address is identified and trackable, providing for audience measurement, but not for identifying recipients or for tracing their response.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">Moreover, after consumer clicks on the ad and reviews the promotional offer, that offer will be lost for the consumer as soon as they leave the landing page. Consequently, it is hard for the consumer to get back to the deal or to share it with their social contacts.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">Compared to the digital world, the impressions of broadcasted ads occur on the TV set or AM/FM radio receiver; both not traceable offline devices. The effects of these impressions are hard to measure and produce at best <b>low engagement</b> and <b>weak retargeting</b> possibilities.</div>

                    <div class="main-text">Ads interrupt the users’ viewing experience, so most users ignore or even block them with the help of ad-blocking apps. At the same time, consumers appreciate receiving deals and offers.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">ECHOTAG Mobile SDK embedded in the mobile app allows storing offers and deals related to the ad (even the one blocked from view) in the dedicated “Offers” folder, thus allowing consumers to review saved offers later on. As it happens, ECHOTAG registers the user’s interest on the server.</div>
                    <div class="main-text"><b><i>Increased PPC volume</i></b></div>
                    <div class="main-text">Most of consumers do not click on ads interrupting their game or show.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">ECHOTAG encourages the user to click on the ad at other times; leading to overall more clicks, increasing the ad’s CTR and CR, and providing an opportunity for higher PPC earnings by the advertising agency.</div>
                    <div class="main-text"><b><i>Precise retargeting</i></b></div>
                    <div class="main-text">ECHOTAG collects user personal info by encouraging mobile app users to register in order to access stored offers and deals. The collected data is a campaign specific and available on ECHOTAG Campaign Management Console.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">With these data insights, the consumer is retargeted with demographic and shopping interest specific ads triggering a response by the consumer, and as a result increasing advertising ROI.</div>
                    <div class="main-text"><b><i>Shareable and viral</i></b></div>
                    <div class="main-text">With ECHOTAG, mobile app users can easily share captured deals with their social contacts, enabling viral distribution of the creative and amplifying its value.</div>
                    <div class="main-text"><b><i>Broadcast merged with digital</i></b></div>
                    <div class="main-text">ECHOTAG provides the means and tools to transmute traditionally broadcasted creative directly into a measurable digital format.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">With ECHOTAG, the ad manager marks their creative’s audio track with a short inaudible “watermark” sound. Consumer mobile devices listen for and automatically detect the inaudible watermark at the time of the ad’s broadcast.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">With ECHOTAG technology, engagement statistics and retargeting info is available to the brands through an in-browser dashboard, or programmatically over the ECHOTAG server-side API.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">By pushing broadcast ads into a digital workflow, advertisers achieve <b>precise tracking</b> of consumer engagement and behavior, as well as ability to <b>measure and analyze</b> activity of their captive audience.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">Finally, ECHOTAG provides ad agency for earning fresh PPC on traditionally broadcasted ads.</div>
                    <div class="main-text"><b><i>Summary</i></b></div>
                    <div class="main-text">ECHOTAG is drastically improving both digital and traditionally broadcasted ad creative’s performance by adding a post-delivery distribution and tracking mechanism to an existing content delivery workflow.</div>
                    <div class="main-text">In short, ECHOTAG strengthens every stage of the ad delivery process by capturing, identifying, counting, and reporting performance statistics. It makes ad creative more valuable by making it work harder, presenting it to a wider audience and lengthening its circulation lifespan, thus <b>increasing the advertising ROI.</b></div>

                        <div>With ECHOTAG, any ad creative delivered to the mobile device or broadcasted over the air is
                          being captured, and the user is able to follow or directly act on the accompanying promotion or
                          offer.
                        </div>
                        <div>In the digital world, there are Google AdSense, Yllix Media and many others who provide data on
                          ad impressions and clicks. ECHOTAG goes far beyond that. It provides for the post-delivery
                          interaction, retrievable offers, viral sharing, consumer identification, and precise retargeting.
                        </div>
                        <div>In the world of over-the-air and cable broadcast, there are several service providers, such as
                          ActusView, Mufin and Alphonso, which monitor the ad impressions across networks. However, none of
                          them goes beyond registering the impression, leaving brands to set up a supporting system to
                          retarget the consumer on their own. The end-user for these platforms (the TV viewer or radio
                          listener) is not presented with an option to interact with the promotion (except dialing a certain
                          800 phone number), and is not even aware of the fact that their impression was registered.
                        </div>
                        <div>ECHOTAG does register the impressions on TV and radio too, but for us it is only the first step.
                          As with the digital ads, ECHOTAG focuses on providing the unique set of post-delivery features for
                          all: broadcasters, brands, ad agencies, and the consumer.
                        </div>
                        <div>We strongly believe that there is no way to improve consumer engagement without presenting
                          consumers with a straightforward incentive and the way to take advantage of it.
                        </div>
                        <div>We stand-alone and differ from all other audience metrics vendors by offering a host of
                          post-delivery services in addition to ad impression data; providing an ability to deliver
                          complementary content such as offers and promotions to the user’s mobile devices. Thus, we enrich
                          the viewer’s experience and make a much better use of the broadcasted ad, delivering far more
                          valuable audience engagement and recognition.
                        </div>
                        <div>Users are encouraged to interact with the captured offer, save it, or share it with friends,
                          thus empowering the viral distribution of the offer. In 2015, 43% mobile device users overall and
                          90% of millennials shared deals socially, with each user having an average 200 social connections
                          to share them with.
                        </div>
                        <div>We follow the viewer’s subsequent activities such as clicks and the number of shares related to
                          the captured offers, so content producers do not have to guess as to how much coverage they are
                          getting with their deployed creative. We also collect data on engagement from secondary recipients
                          (friends), and continue to do so for the entire period in which the ad is still running.
                        </div>
                        <div>In summary, while other ACR platforms simply confirm the delivery of content, ECHOTAG provides a
                          unique set of user incentive and call-to-action features, as well as post-delivery capabilities not
                          available anywhere else on the market.
                        </div>
                        <div>From a technological standpoint, unlike others, the ECHOTAG Platform is available as a portable
                          middleware for integration with existing software over its server-to-server API and Mobile SDK.

            <div>With ECHOTAG, any ad creative delivered to the mobile device or broadcasted over the air is
              being captured, and the user is able to follow or directly act on the accompanying promotion or
              offer.
            </div>
            <div>In the digital world, there are Google AdSense, Yllix Media and many others who provide data on
              ad impressions and clicks. ECHOTAG goes far beyond that. It provides for the post-delivery
              interaction, retrievable offers, viral sharing, consumer identification, and precise retargeting.
            </div>
            <div>In the world of over-the-air and cable broadcast, there are several service providers, such as
              ActusView, Mufin and Alphonso, which monitor the ad impressions across networks. However, none of
              them goes beyond registering the impression, leaving brands to set up a supporting system to
              retarget the consumer on their own. The end-user for these platforms (the TV viewer or radio
              listener) is not presented with an option to interact with the promotion (except dialing a certain
              800 phone number), and is not even aware of the fact that their impression was registered.
            </div>
            <div>ECHOTAG does register the impressions on TV and radio too, but for us it is only the first step.
              As with the digital ads, ECHOTAG focuses on providing the unique set of post-delivery features for
              all: broadcasters, brands, ad agencies, and the consumer.
            </div>
            <div>We strongly believe that there is no way to improve consumer engagement without presenting
              consumers with a straightforward incentive and the way to take advantage of it.
            </div>
            <div>We stand-alone and differ from all other audience metrics vendors by offering a host of
              post-delivery services in addition to ad impression data; providing an ability to deliver
              complementary content such as offers and promotions to the user’s mobile devices. Thus, we enrich
              the viewer’s experience and make a much better use of the broadcasted ad, delivering far more
              valuable audience engagement and recognition.
            </div>
            <div>Users are encouraged to interact with the captured offer, save it, or share it with friends,
              thus empowering the viral distribution of the offer. In 2015, 43% mobile device users overall and
              90% of millennials shared deals socially, with each user having an average 200 social connections
              to share them with.
            </div>
            <div>We follow the viewer’s subsequent activities such as clicks and the number of shares related to
              the captured offers, so content producers do not have to guess as to how much coverage they are
              getting with their deployed creative. We also collect data on engagement from secondary recipients
              (friends), and continue to do so for the entire period in which the ad is still running.
            </div>
            <div>In summary, while other ACR platforms simply confirm the delivery of content, ECHOTAG provides a
              unique set of user incentive and call-to-action features, as well as post-delivery capabilities not
              available anywhere else on the market.
            </div>
            <div>From a technological standpoint, unlike others, the ECHOTAG Platform is available as a portable
              middleware for integration with existing software over its server-to-server API and Mobile SDK.
